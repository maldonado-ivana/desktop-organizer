# File Organizer Script

## Overview
This script organizes files within a specified folder into subfolders based on their file extensions. The script uses the 'os' and 'shut' modules. 

## Usage
1. Clone or download the script file (`organize_files.py`) to your local machine.
2. Open the script file and specify the target folder path in the `target_folder_path` variable.
3. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    ```
    python organize_files.py
    ```
4. The script will organize the files in the specified folder into subfolders based on their file extensions.

## Important Note
Ensure that the target folder path specified in the script exists and is accessible. The script will not work if the folder path is invalid.
